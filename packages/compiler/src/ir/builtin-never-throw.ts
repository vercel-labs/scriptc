 * `valueOf`, `toString`, a proxy trap or a callback), under any argument.

 * Every builtin states its answer once: a row in MAY_THROW_LIB_FNS
 * (builtin-effects.ts) or a row here. A builtin in neither is compiled
 * without the check that delivers its error, so the error is lost and the
 * caller reads a placeholder result. The compiler does not read this set;
 * packages/compiler/test/builtin-attributes.test.ts holds every builtin to
 * the rule, and builtin-throw-undecided.txt lists the builtins that
 * predate it. */
